## Features

‚úÖ Directly makes the API request (using JWT's).\
‚úÖ Handles API responses & errors, printing available balances or errors properly.\
‚úÖ Uses config.json for credentials, keeping them separate from the script. \
‚úÖ Integrates with the [CryptoBot-Monitor](https://github.com/royen99/cryptobot-monitor) dashboard for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## How It Works

All scripts need at least a `config.json` file that has your Coinbase API credentials and a 

### Config Example (config.json)
```json
{
    "name": "organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}",
    "privateKey": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR PRIVATE KEY\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
}
```

See the `config.json.template` file for the full example (some scripts utilize additional settings).

**Ensure the `config.json` is securely stored** and not exposed in public repositories.

### Trade Logic

‚úÖ Uses a PostgreSQL database backend for saving and loading price history and trading state.\
‚úÖ Asynchronous API requests, improving performance and responsiveness.\
‚úÖ Trades multiple cryptocurrencies with configurable settings.\
‚úÖ Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to identify trend direction and momentum.\
‚úÖ Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions.\
‚úÖ Integrated MACD and RSI signals into the trading strategy. \
‚úÖ Inspects bollinger bands to determine price volatility and potential breakouts. \
‚úÖ Calculates stochastic RSI indicator for additional momentum analysis. \
‚úÖ Rebuy signals based on market conditions to reach dollar-cost averaging.

üö® Note that the various indicators will only function with enough data points (depending on your settings).

Without enough price history you will see log lines such as:\
‚ö†Ô∏è LTC: Not enough data for indicators. Required: 51, Available: 46.\
‚ö†Ô∏è ETH: Not enough data for long-term MA. Skipping.

## Installation

Prepare your PostgreSQL database by using the `init_db.sql` file. This will create the necessary tables and schema.

Use the supplied config.json.template file for your CoinBase API credentials, database connection settings, and other configurations. \
Make sure to rename it to `config.json` and fill in your details and place it in the appropriate directory. (.env by default)

1. Use the Docker Compose file to start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-sample.yml up -d
   ```

2. Run the Docker container directly:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name cryptobot-trader royen99/cryptobot-trader
   ```

When adding coins to the `config.json` file, ensure you follow the same structure as the sample entries.
Each coin should have its own section with the necessary parameters.

Take care of the proper `precision` settings for each coin (`price` and `amount`).
When in doubt, you can check the Coinbase API documentation ([XRP Example](https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/currencies/XRP)) for the correct values.
